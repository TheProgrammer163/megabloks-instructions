Old Mega Bloks .PDF instructions for a TON of sets.

------------------------------------------------------------

These instruction manuals archives are here for historical purposes.
If no one makes an effort to archive them, they will eventually
be permanently lost through time.

Each .PDF file has the set number as its name. If you cannot find a set
using its number then it isn't archived here.

Some instruction manuals are missing. For example, those of Alien Agency 5631 and 5611.
If you have physical copies of manuals or digital copies that you'd like to see added to
the archive, you can message me via Reddit. My Reddit username is SamSibbens.

This archive has been possible  thanks to a redditor who posted a link with these .PDF instructions files to download:

NOTE: I cleaned up and organized instructions that were directly in the "micro" folder.
